# ML-SP500
ML SP500 explores machine learning for S&amp;P 500 prediction using lagged variables. The project compares Linear Regression and Random Forest: regression captures the trend but lags behind, while Random Forest overfits and flattens. Results show that simple models may outperform complex methods in financial time series.
